# DBpedia Spotlight Dashboard
### Progress
**[17/05/2021]**: Proposal acceptance and community bonding period started.

**[27/05/2021]**: Meeting the mentors on Google Meet to introduce ourselves and talk about the project and interesting ideas:
 - Load data from **Wikistats** (uriCounts, pairCounts, sfAndTotalCounts and tokenCounts) and **DBpedia artifacts** (instance-types, redirects and disambiguations) in dataframes using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [RDFLib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) libraries.
 - Create the desired visualizations using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library.
 - Use frameworks like [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) for building the dashboard. 
 - Compute the desired statistics over the dataframe using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library. 
 - Publish the statistical data generated using [Linked Open Vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/) once the dashboard is built.
