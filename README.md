### Objective

The purpose of this dashboard is to **facilitate the understanding and analysis of both DBpedia datasets ([instance-types](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/mappings/instance-types/),  [redirects ](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/generic/redirects) and [disambiguations](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/generic/disambiguations/)) and [Wikipedia's statistics ](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/spotlight/spotlight-wikistats/) (uriCounts, pairCounts, sfAndTotalCounts and tokenCounts)** by calculating statistical measures on these data that allow understanding the trends of **DBpedia resources**, **Wikipedia links** and **surface forms**.
 
 To make the dashboard, these steps have been followed:

 1. **Obtain raw data** from the DBpedia Databus
 2. **Entity validation process**: throughout the project, it was seen that there are Spotlight entities whose type is **unknown**. This process consists of determining the DBpedia entities with `known types` and those with `unknown types`.
DBpedia entities with **known types** will be found in one of the following datasets: `instance-types`, `redirects`, and `disambiguations`. 
Whereas entities with **unknown types** will not be found in any of them. 
 3. **Computation of statistical measures**: percentage of entities with known types over the total (precision), percentage of entities with unknown types over the total (impact), mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles...
 4. **Plot dashboard figures**

### Raw Data
As mentioned before, the statistical measures have been calculated from the **DBpedia datasets** and the Wikipedia statistical files (**Wikistats**)

#### DBpedia Datasets
- **redirects.nt**: contains the redirect links extracted from Wikipedia redirection pages
- **disambiguations.nt**: contains the disambiguation links extracted from Wikipedia disambiguation pages
- **instance_types.nt**: classification of instances with the DBpedia Ontology. Triple containers of the form `<$ resource> rdf: type <$ dbpedia_ontology_class>` generated by the mappings extraction.

| DBpedia Dataset | Sample |
|---|---|
|redirects.nt  |`<http://es.dbpedia.org/resource/Artesanal><http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageRedirects> <http://es.dbpedia.org/resource/Artesanía.`
|disambiguations.nt  | `<http://es.dbpedia.org/resource/Abate> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageDisambiguates> <http://es.dbpedia.org/resource/Carlo_Abate> .` |
|instance_types.nt  |`<http://es.dbpedia.org/resource/Cristiano_Ronaldo> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Athlete> .`  |

#### Wikistats
- **uriCounts**: Contains the number of times each DBpedia resource (URI) appears in the Wikipedia dump
- **pairCounts**: contains the number of times that a text (surface form) is used to link a DBpedia resource
- **sfAndTotalCounts**: Contains the number of times a text (surface form) appears linked to a DBpedia resource (second column) and also the number of times it appears unlinked (third column).
- **tokenCounts**: contains the number of times the words (tokens) appear in each Wikipedia article

|File |Sample  |
|---|---|
|uriCounts |`http://es.dbpedia.org/resource/Ciudadanía_rusa 69`|
|pairCounts  |`ciudadanos rusos http://es.dbpedia.org/resource/Ciudadanía_rusa	5`|
|sfAndTotalCounts  |`ciudadanos rusos	5	133`  |
|tokenCounts  |`http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_Wall_Street	{(street,13),(wall,11),(edifici,10),(del,5),(adyacent,5),(broadway,4)...}`|

Dashboard tabs*

[Figure 2](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/1_tabs.png) shows the 4 main tabs of the dashboard

#### Information tab
This tab explains:
 - The **purpose** of this dashboard
 - How the **statistics** have been computed
 - The **entity validation** process
 - The **raw files** that DBpedia Spotlight uses during the generation of a language model
 
![Information](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/2_information.png)
 
#### Instance-types comparison tab
This tab is used to compare the `instance-types` of the versions *October 2016,* *October 2020*, *May 2021* and *June 2021* for **English** and **Spanish** languages

It is divided into 3 views:
 - **Version comparison**: a table to compare the number of entities and types of the selected versions as well as their differences
 
 ![Version Comparison](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/3_comparison.png)

 - **Version 1 VS Version 2**:  a chart illustrates the number of entities from the selected versions
 
![VS](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/4_comparison.png)

 - **DBpedia types comparison**: the entities from each selected version are graphically compared based on the [DBpedia hierarchy of classes](http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/ontology/classes/)
 
![Types comparison](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/5_comparison.png)

#### Details tab
It contains 6 sub-tabs:
 - Summary
 - Instance-types
 - uriCounts
 - pairCounts
 - tokenCounts
 - sfAndTotalCounts

![Sub-tabs](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/6_details.png)
 
 ##### Summary
 It shows the calculated statistics.
 
 It can be seen **measures of central tendency** (mean and mode) that are used to know where the data is inclined or clustered the most. In this case, we can see how the DBpedia entities, surface forms and Wikipedia tokens are grouped.
 Also it can be seen the standard deviation, which is the main **measure of dispersion**, that is used to observe the degree of variability of DBpedia entities, surface forms and Wikipedia tokens.

![Summary](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/7_details.png)

##### Instance-types
Allows to view the instance-types in more detail for the selected language and version

![Instance-types](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/8_details.png)


It is divided in two main sections:

 - **DBpedia Extraction Framework**: to see metrics about the `raw files` of the DBpedia Databus that Spotlight uses to generate the models
 - **DBpedia Spotlight**: to see metrics about the entities and types that are actually used by DBpedia Spotlight after the `entity validation process`
 
 Both sections are formed by the following views:
 - **Measures of Central Tendency**: mean, mode
 - **Measures of Dispersion**: standard deviation
 
 ![Instance-types measures](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/9_details.png)

 - **Entities by DBpedia types** 
 
![Instance-types entities and types](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/10_details.png)

Moreover, the following views can be seen in the **DBpedia Spotlight** section:
 - **Precision and impact** calculated after `entity validation process`

These measurements are used to find out which Spotlight entities have **known DBpedia types** and which entities have **unknown types**. They are calculated as follows: 

![Precision and impact formulas](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/precision_impact.png)

In the following image it can be seen that 63% of entities present known types and 27% present unknown types in the case of **English** language in **May 2021** version: 

![Precision and impact](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/11_details.png)

 - **Position measures for DBpedia types** (quartiles and percentiles)

 - **Measures of Dispersion**: standard deviation
 
 ![tokenCounts](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/16_details.png)

##### sfAndTotalCounts
Allows to see metrics calculated from the **sfAndTotalCounts file**

The main measures are:
 - **Measures of Central Tendency**: mean, mode, median
 - **Measures of Dispersion**: standard deviation
 
![sfAndTotalCounts](https://raw.github.com/dbpedia/DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard/main/images/doc/17_details.png)

In addition, it can be seen the surface forms according to their state in the **Wikipedia dump**:
 - **Without associated link** (**-1** in second file column)
 - **Not appearing as text** (**0** in third file column)
 - **Not appearing as text without associated link** (**-1** in second file column and **0** in third file column)
 - **Rest** (surface forms with associated link and appearing as text)

### Evaluation

###  Used Tools
 - [GNU datamash](https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/) for statistics calculation
 - [Dash framework](https://dash.plotly.com/) for building the web app
 - [Plotly Python graphing library](https://plotly.com/python/) for visualizations
 - [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) for development and integration

### How to Run
In order to run the dashboard on yout local system, it is only necessary to:
- Clone the repository
- Go to the root folder and execute `main.sh` script

The script will install all the necessary packages and modules

### Conclusions
Throughout this work, **raw data** used by DBpedia Spotlight for the elaboration of models has been obtained, these data have been submitted to the **entity validation process**. Then, **statistical measures** have been calculated and finally a **dashboard** has been built showing these measures using **cards** and **charts**.

**Measures of central tendency** have been calculated, that are used to see where the data are grouped the most. **Dispersion measures** have also been calculated, that are used to see the degree of variability of the data. Finally, **position measures** have been calculated, that divide the data into intervals of the same size.

After analyzing all these measures, the **high degree of dispersion** in the data has been observed. In addition, it has been seen that a large part of the information falls on the **first quartile**.

### Future Work
These are some tasks that would be interesting to do in the future:
- Include the rest of the languages available in DBpedia-Spotlight in the `Details` and `Instance-types comparison` tabs.
- Define the statistical information as Linked Data
- Define an onotlogy for the representation of statistical information
