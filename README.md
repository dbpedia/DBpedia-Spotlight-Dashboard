# DBpedia-Spotlight-Dashboard
An integrated statistical information tool from the Wikipedia dumps and the DBpedia Extraction Framework artifacts

### Objective

The purpose of this dashboard is to **facilitate the understanding and analysis of both DBpedia datasets ([instance-types](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/mappings/instance-types/),  [redirects ](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/generic/redirects) and [disambiguations](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/generic/disambiguations/)) and [Wikipedia's statistics ](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/spotlight/spotlight-wikistats/) (uriCounts, pairCounts, sfAndTotalCounts and tokenCounts)** by calculating statistical measures on these data that allow understanding the trends of **DBpedia resources**, **Wikipedia links** and **surface forms**.
 
 To make the dashboard, it is first necessary to **obtain the raw data**.  Subsequently, it is verified that the DBpedia entities (URLs) that Spotlight uses (URLs of the `uriCounts` file) are found  in one of the three DBpedia datasets (`instance-types`, `redirects` and `disambiguations`).  If they are found in a dataset, they are entities whose type is **known** (from DBpedia), on the contrary,  if they are not found in any dataset, they are entities whose type is **unknown**.  This process is called **entity validation**. 
Once `valid URLs` (of known type), `invalid URLs` (of unknown type)  and the `DBpedia types` that each URL present are known, a series of **statistical measures** are calculated on the data  (percentage of valid URLs over the total (**precision**), percentage of invalid URLs over the total (**impact**), mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles , percentiles, etc).   
Afterwards, **necessary figures** are generated to visualize the statistics.  Once all the figures are ready, they are placed and the final dashboard is obtained.
